Docker - Platform designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications using containers. Containers allow developers to package up an application with all parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. This ensures that the application runs reliably and consistently regardless of the environment in which it's deployed.
