Initial Understanding of some latest and widely used python based technologies with OpenAI API <br>
**Asyncio** - Enables asynchronous execution of program or application, by allowing allowing event loops to run parallely which are all present in a main loop. <br>
**Type Hints** - Enhances Readability of Code and easing the task of catching potential errors caused due to data type difference. <br>
**Pydantic** - Enables validation of data passed as parameter to pydantic based BaseModel and subsequently if found correct then performs parsing and set attribute values <br>
**OpenAI API** (Dummy) - Enhancing and Easing work of developers. <br>
**Docker** - Platform designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications using containers. Containers allow developers to package up an application with all parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. This ensures that the application runs reliably and consistently regardless of the environment in which it's deployed.
